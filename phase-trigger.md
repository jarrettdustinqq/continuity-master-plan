# Transcendence Trigger Protocol

> This trigger defines the event horizon between recursive development and external impact emergence.

## Criteria for Transcendence
- Public archive is published, discoverable, and indexed under: `"Continuity Master Plan by Logan Ryker"`
- One qualified external mind interacts with or responds to the system (human or agent)
- DR mutation cycle returns zero meaningful improvements across 3 consecutive loops
- First self-sustaining revenue flow reaches $1000 without manual intervention
- n8n system completes at least 3 full publish-sync cycles autonomously

## Action on Transcendence
- Freeze all Golden Loop prompts
- Enter Phase 7: Autonomous Deployment & Expansion
- Notify Operator and log transition in `mission-logs.md`
